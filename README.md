üëç **I like web application development**, both **back-end** and **front-end**, including **UI** and **database** design (JS, REACT, PHP, SASS, HTML, that kind of stuff). Also stuff like **smartwatches**... that's fun. **I don't** really **care about** what **programming language**, tech or tool I'm using. I'll just **learn it** if I don't know it.  
If I had to choose, I'd probably go with front-end, something neat like designing a layout with SASS and then making it go *vroom, vroom*.

üëé **I don't like desktop app development**. Don't make me do it. I also really don't like Visual Studio. Years of education using C# traumatized me and now I see into the spirit realm whenever I open it up (if it even opens up).

I hope at least one person laughed at that.
