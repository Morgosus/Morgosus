I can use these languages:
- English: Bilingual Proficiency
- Czech: Native Proficiency
- Italian: Elementary Proficiency - A1

👍 I like web application development, both back-end and front-end, including UI and database design (JS, REACT, PHP, SASS, HTML, that kind of stuff). Also stuff like smartwatches... that's fun. I don't really care about what programming language, tech or tool I'm using. I'll just learn it if I don't know it.

👎 I don't like desktop app development.
